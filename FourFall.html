BY BRUCE WEIGL <br>
I watch the woods for deer as if I’m armed. <br>
I watch the woods for deer who never come. <br>
I know the hes and shes in autumn <br>
rendezvous in orchards stained with fallen <br>
apples’ scent. I drive my car this way to work <br>
so I may let the crows in corn believe <br>
it’s me their caws are meant to warn, <br>
and snakes who turn in warm and secret caves <br>

they know me too. They know the boy <br>
who lives inside me still won’t go away. <br>
The deer are ghosts who slip between the light <br>
through trees, so you may only hear the snap <br>
of branches in the thicket beyond hope. <br>
I watch the woods for deer, as if I’m armed. <br>
