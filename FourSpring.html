By Thomas Carew <br>

Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost <br>
Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost <br>
Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream <br>
Upon the silver lake or crystal stream; <br>
But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth, <br>
And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth <br>
To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree <br>
The drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee. <br>
Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring <br>
In triumph to the world the youthful Spring. <br>
The valleys, hills, and woods in rich array <br>
Welcome the coming of the long'd-for May. <br>
Now all things smile, only my love doth lour; <br>
Nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power <br>
To melt that marble ice, which still doth hold <br>
Her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold. <br>
The ox, which lately did for shelter fly <br>
Into the stall, doth now securely lie <br>
In open fields; and love no more is made <br>
By the fireside, but in the cooler shade <br>
Amyntas now doth with his Chloris sleep <br>
Under a sycamore, and all things keep <br>
Time with the season; only she doth carry <br>
June in her eyes, in her heart January. <br>
