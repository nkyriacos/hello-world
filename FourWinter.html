Robert Frost <br>

Whose woods these are I think I know. <br>
His house is in the village though; <br>
He will not see me stopping here <br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow. <br>

My little horse must think it queer <br>
To stop without a farmhouse near <br>
Between the woods and frozen lake <br>
The darkest evening of the year. <br>

He gives his harness bells a shake <br>
To ask if there is some mistake. <br>
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep <br>
Of easy wind and downy flake. <br>

The woods are lovely, dark and deep, <br>
But I have promises to keep, <br>
And miles to go before I sleep <br>
And miles to go before I sleep. <br>
