Here we go, oh, oh <br>
Seasons of the year <br>
Here comes the spring with the rain pouring down <br>
Here comes the spring with the flowers in the ground <br>
Here comes the spring with the rainbow in the sky <br>
Here comes the spring to bring new life <br>
Here comes the summer with the heat from the sun <br>
Here comes the summer with the kids having fun <br>
Here comes the summer with the warm breeze <br>
Here comes the summer with the trees so green <br>
Here comes the fall with the leaves changing color <br>
Here comes the fall with the climate getting cooler <br>
Here comes the fall with the leaves falling down <br>
Here comes the fall with the wind blowing loud <br>
Here comes the winter with the ice and the snow <br>
Here comes the winter with the freezing cold <br>
Here comes the winter with the days getting shorter <br>
Here comes the winter with the nights getting longer <br>
