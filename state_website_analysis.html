		<h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a>
		<p>Ranking: 4</p>
		<p> Very linear style source code. The color scheme is boring as nearly everything is blue with sprinkles of yellow. It is fairly easy to navigate as there are nice drop down menus and pictures that turn into information when you hover over them. Information needs to be more spaced out as it is all congested down the middle of the screen. Loading isn’t instantaneous but doesn't take too long. Website is exact same on iphone which makes it inconvinient to use. Font is too small to read, thus you have too zoom in to use the website.</p>
		
		<h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a>
		<p>Ranking: 3</p>
		<p>The visuals are too big which and as a result you have to scroll for ages to view all the content on the page. There is lots of color which makes it appealing. The webiste is easy to read because it has big bold lettering. It is easy to navigate as there are bold titles such as 'government', 'business', 'home' etc. as well as a big search bar. The 'Quick Links' option is very helpful fo the user as they can access information quickly. Each column title has a nice drop down menu. Unlike Oklahoma, important statistics such as unemployment rate, graduation rate are available on the homepage. I like how the pictures are used to represent information such as a car representing transportation, a leaf representing Iowa’s outdoors etc. The source code seems to be well-organized as there are good indentations etc. Still very overwhelming to read and has elements which holds information that never seems to end. On the phone the site is inconvenient to use as you have to scroll down for ages to access all the information available. Still very easy to read and eye-pleasing.</p>
		
		<h1><a href="https://www.ok.gov/">Oklahoma</a>
		<p>Ranking: 5. This is my least favorite website for these reasons:</p>
		<p>The website has a very bland color scheme as well as grass background that makes it very dull. It is difficult to navigate website as there is basically only a search bar. There are no drop down menus as well as lots of unhelpful information such tweets and irrelevant statistics about oklahoma .It feels like they are just trying to take up space. The website seems to load quickly. This website is very confusing to me. The home button was difficult to find due to its color and its small font which was evident throughout the page. I find the website even harder to navigate on the phone as the site is missing information available to computer users such as state agencies, newsrooms, maps etc. On the phone, there is a very boring white background,as well as little important information. It seems like a lazy attempt at a website, as if they website designers are forcing the users to use the search bar.

		<h1><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a>
		<p>Ranking: 2</p>
		<p>The website is very  eye-catching as it has a nice variation of color. There is a nice balance of white and blue as well as red and yellow accents .  The pictures and information are stretched nicely across screen. The site is easy to navigate as there are nice drop down menus as well as clear and precise font. There is nice spacing established between elements on screen.The  background is very pretty because pictures used to enhance information such as the photo of a family behind the title ‘Family’ as well as business workers behind the title ‘Business’. You don’t have to scroll for a long time to get to the bottom of the screen which is refreshing. A simple design style is used therefore the user is not overwhelmed with information. The pictures sometimes take a while to load. Once you get deeper into the website, it starts to become more bland. There appear to be less pictures, fewer words and more empty blocks with titles.The  phone design is very nice. It is well organised, easy to read, high quality visulas and big bold titles.

		<h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">Vermont</a>
		<p>Ranking: 1. This is my favorite webiste for these reasons:</p>
		<p>The imagery is beautiful. There is an explosion of natural color. Nice spacing is established between graphical elements. The site is easy to navigate as there is a very sharp organization of the elements. Big bold titles are available with drop down menu which makes the site very easy to read and access. There is a very thick and explicit search bar. Little scrolling required for the user which differentiates it from some of the other sites. The website uses essential information only. The website also possesses a thorough design style as it continues to be exciting even as you go deeper into it.The site loads quickly. Using the site on the phone has almost the exact same feel as the computer.
