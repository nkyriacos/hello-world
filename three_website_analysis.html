		<h1><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a>
		<p>Great</p>
		<p>The site has a very slick, clean design. It uses a white canvas background and the vibrant shoes create explosions of color. The pictures are large and are spaced well and are soothing on the eyes. This also makes it easy to identify information such as prices, sizes etc. A drop down menu is used which makes it easy to navigate through the site. A hamburger menu is placed in the top right corner and isn’t used as an anchor for navigation which is good. 
			They use HTML5 elements. The code is broken up into important blocks of information. You can click on arrows to expand the code to view it in more detail. Good indentations are used. They use tables and it looks very complicated. 
			Kids, mens, womens etc. are categorized above. They are placed in an overarching bar.  Big colorful pictures are used to catch the eye and guide the navigation. They include simple labels. Different themes of clothing are divided into different rows. There doesn’t appear to be a scrolling effect but scrolling is required to make it down to the bottom. 
			The sprinkles of color complement the site and the white versus colorful contrast brings emphasis to the shoes. This matches their proudcts because we know Nike to be classy/colorful etc. Sports pictures are used to appeal to sportsmen, stylish shoes to appeal to those concerned with fashion. 
			Small nike tick top left corner looks very classy. It also gives the site a stamp of authenticity. It communicates to the user that the site is of the same quality as the products, therefore consistency.

		<h1><a href="https://www.mbusa.com/en/home">Mercedez Benz</a>
		<p>Great</p>
		<p>This site is almost entirely pictures which makes it unique. It is aesthetically pleasing. It doesn’t use a menu which brings your attention to the cars. It uses a  
			The code isn’t indented which makes it confusing. They do not appear to use tables. They use a lot of meta tags which are apparently unconventional for web developers. They do not appear to use HTML5 elements. 
			There is an awesome scrolling effect. The pictures move vertically in place which  The pictures seamlessly dissolve into one another. It creates this satisfying feeling of being able to slide layers of images over one another. 
			It is very easy to navigate. The site uses pictures in the form of columns with bold symbolized titles. This makes the experience very intuitive for the user. Nice sharp rectangular buttons are used and their blue makes them stand out nicely against the white background. 
			The colors scheme feels warm, natural, sereen. The site intentionally uses spring colors in spring time to imply that their vehicles are authentic and  adapted to all conditions. The site looks very sophisticated, classy just like the cars, appealing to a wealthy audience.

		<h1><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale Art School</a>
		<p>Very Bad</p>
		<p> This site looks just like abstract art itself, that is like a bunch of random colors and shapes have been thrown onto a website. It feels too busy and disorganized. There is no color scheme, rather a spectrum of arbitrary colors which coexist in the chaos. It looks very amateurish, like a website that one creates on the first day of web design class. Everything is separated into blocks which are squashed on top/beside of another like New York apartments. 
			No indentations. No HTML5 elements. No tables. 
			There is no scrolling effect. As mentioned above, there isn’t a layout to the site. The site makes no sense, maybe intentionally like some forms of art don’t make sense unless you really think about them, but nobody wants to invest intellectual energy into making sense of this garbage. 
			No you cannot navigate this website. It feels like you are stuck inside a maze where the corridors are screaming at you.  
			As mentioned above, there is no color scheme. They might as well have given a box of crayons to a monkey. Since I don’t understand or appreciate art, it does appear that they are appealing to artists as the everyday person would not appreciate such a form of art.
			Only rectangles which make the site rigid, harsh and disconnected. No white space is used, small text, too many different font sizes, and too many advertisements. The site is so jambled that you don’t actually know what you're supposed to be looking at.
